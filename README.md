# task1
A C program computes the sum of integers from 1 to N by inputting N, using a for loop to calculate the sum, and displaying the result. The program is compiled using a RISC-V compiler. The generated assembly code is inspected ,efficiency is analyzed by counting instructions in the main function with optimizations: O1-15 and Ofast-12 instructions
